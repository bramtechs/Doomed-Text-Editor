# Doomed Text Editor

Attempt at a zero BS, distraction free, working out of the box text editor thats reasonably fast and intuitive to use.

Just making an editor that fits my needs. It probably won't fit yours.

## Technologies
- Java
- LibGDX scene2d.ui

## Roadmap
- File explorer
- Fuzzy file search
- JSON config and GUI config
- Splits
- Theming
- Basic language modes
- Move lines by pressing Alt
- Terminal macros

### This will not be added
- LSP support
- Treesitter-like highlighting
- Plugin support
- Vim or Emacs bindings (don't use them anymore)
